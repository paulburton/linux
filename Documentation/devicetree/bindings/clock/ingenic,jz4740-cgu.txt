Ingenic jz4740 SoC CGU binding

The CGU in a jz4740 SoC provides all the clocks generated on-chip. It includes
PLLs, multiplexers, dividers & gates in order to provide a variety of different
clock signals derived from only 2 external source clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4740-cgu"
- reg: Should be the address & length of the CGU registers
- clocks: Should contain the phandle & clock specifier for two clocks external
          to the TCU. First the external crystal "ext" and second the RTC
          clock source "rtc".
- clock-names: Should be set to strings naming the clocks specified in the
               "clocks" property.
- #clock-cells: Should be 1.
                Clock consumers specify this argument to identify a clock. The
                valid values may be found in <dt-bindings/clock/jz4740-cgu.h>.

Example SoC include file:

/ {
	cgu: jz4740-cgu {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-cgu";
		reg = <0x10000000 0x100>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	uart0: serial@10030000 {
		clocks = <&cgu JZ4740_CLK_UART0>;
	};
};

Example board file:

/ {
	ext: clock@0 {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <12000000>;
	};

	rtc: clock@1 {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <32768>;
	};

	&cgu {
		clocks = <&ext> <&rtc>;
		clock-names: "ext", "rtc";
	};
};
